# The DE-bundle Distribution

The DE-bundle is a program, which installs a python distribution and relevant scientific software and libraries
for doing data analysis in the field of electron microscopy. This distribution is forked from the
HyperSpy-bundle and we greatly appreciate the work done by the hyperspy team.  The major difference
is that the DE-Bundle is more focused on providing a distribution with packages specifically tailored
for the needs of Direct-Electron customers. That being said any and all are welcome to use this distribution!

The DE-bundle is a python distribution that includes the following packages:
    - Python
    - HyperSpy (and all its dependencies, pyxem, rosettasciio, kikuchipy, lumispy, etc.)
    - py4DSTEM
    - LiberTEM 
    - DE-API
    - Scientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-image etc.)
    - Panel
    - JupyterLab
    - Plotting libraries (matplotlib, ipympl, bokeh)
    -
